Install Dependencies: Ensure you have Docker, Elasticsearch, and Python installed. Install required Python packages using:
pip install elasticsearch hdfs streamlit

Set Up Docker: Create a Docker container for Elasticsearch:
docker run -d -p 9200:9200 -e "discovery.type=single-node" elasticsearch:7.10.0

Run the Ingestion Script: Modify the HDFS path in the ingestion script to point to your data, and run the script to ingest the data into Elasticsearch:
python ingest_script.py

Run Queries: Use the query function to search for terms:
result = query_tweets("COVID", "twitter_data")
print(result)
